## What is ddev-sqlsrv?

This add-on quickly installs the MS SQL server into a DDEV project.
It is based on the [mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server) image.

You have to keep in mind that the [mssql-docker](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker) does not natively work on M1 (arm64).
Some workarounds are described in the following threads:
* [Does not work on Mac M1](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker/issues/734)
* [MSSQL container for aarch64 (arm64) for better performance](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker/issues/802)

## Installation

**Due to lack of upstream support, this add-on can only be used with amd64 machines, and is not usable on arm64 machines like Apple Silicon computers.**

For DDEV v1.23.5 or above run

```bash
ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-sqlsrv
```

For earlier versions of DDEV run

```bash
ddev get ddev/ddev-sqlsrv
```

Then restart your project

```bash
ddev restart
```

If your project already has a `.ddev/.env` file, you need to add the following lines to it:

```dotenv
MSSQL_EXTERNAL_PORT=1433
MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Password12!
MSSQL_PID=Evaluation
MSSQL_DB_NAME=master
MSSQL_HOST=sqlsrv
```

## Drupal Notice

Drupal CMS needs the database function installed that is mimicking the Regex function as Drupal requires. As a one-time setup for Drupal, install the database function by running the following command from your project's directory:

```bash
ddev drupal-regex
```

This script also changes the setting for the following database variables:

* `show advanced options` will be set to 1
* `clr strict security` will be set to 0
* `clr enable` will be set to 1

Drupal also required the [`sqlsrv` module](https://www.drupal.org/project/sqlsrv) to be installed as it is provides the database driver for SQL Server. The module can be installed with composer with the following command:

```bash
ddev composer require drupal/sqlsrv
```

**There is an open issue for Drupal 9.4+ installations. Until merged, you need to apply [patch #4](https://www.drupal.org/project/sqlsrv/issues/3291199#comment-14576456), see [Call to a member function fetchField() on null
](https://www.drupal.org/project/sqlsrv/issues/3291199)**

## Manually enabling MySQL/MariaDB

**This addons disables the default database by automatically adding `omit_containers: [db,dba]`Â in the `config.sqlsrv.yaml`**

If your project needs to use both MariaDB and MS SQL Server databases, you have to remove `#ddev-generated` and
`omit_containers: [db,dba]` from `config.sqlsrv.yaml`.

See [.ddev/config.yaml Options](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/config_yaml/) for additional notes.
